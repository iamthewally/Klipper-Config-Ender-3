# Klipper-Config-Ender-3

Klipper configuration files for my Ender 3.  Recently broke out the macros and major components into their own cfg files in subfolders.  My current process for swapping tool heads (via crab) is to change the include statement in the printer.cfg and running a PID tune once the printer starts up.


It is an Ender 3 V2 with the following mods:

Pi 4B + Klipper/FluiddPi
BTT SKR E3 Turbo boar

Dual Independent Z Motors

Extruder: 

- Biqu H2 V2S Revo - MAD duct dual 5015 fans

- E3D Hemera + Volcano + Tungsten nozzle for running CF filaments

Biqu Crab Mounting System

3DFused X rail

Dyze Horizon ABL (Mounted between Crab and Carriage

Cheap LED light from amazon taped to top rail
